=> each of the client-folder, server-folder, and project-folder hosting both those. 
all three of them have their own package.json


=> client-folder is just the react-project-folder put inside the client-folder
to run just the front-end, cd into client, and install dependencies using 'npm install' and run the project using 'npm start'


=> server-folder is just the mvc-express-project like we did before
to run just the back-end, cd into server, and install dependencies using 'npm install' and run the project using 'npm start'
