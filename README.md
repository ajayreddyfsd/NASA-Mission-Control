# MERN Full Stack NASA Mission Control Project

A full-stack NASA Mission Control project I built as part of the Artemis initiative. This application lets users explore data from NASA and SpaceX while simulating mission control operations. I deployed it to production using Docker and AWS, following modern best practices for scalable, performant applications with Node.js and MongoDB. The project is inspired by NASAâ€™s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence for future space exploration.
